### Description
#This assignment for the COMP3104 DevOps course involves creating a project 
#that showcases collaborative software development using Git and DevOps 
#practices. The primary focus is on implementing:
#Branching strategies to manage the contributions from multiple developers.
#Continuous Integration (CI) using automated tools.
#Continuous Deployment (CD) to ensure the code is continuously built, tested,
#and deployed to production or staging environments. The project serves as a
#learning exercise to master the integration of tools, processes, and practices 
#essential to modern software development workflows. 

### Setup Instructions
#1. Clone the repository.
#2. Switch to your branch using `git checkout STUDENTID-Name`.

#Ci/CD Pipeline
#The project utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The workflow 
#is defined in `.github/workflows/blank.yml`.

# Branching Strategy
#Each member has their own branch named `STUDENTID-Name`. All changes are 
#merged into the `main` branch via Pull Requests.

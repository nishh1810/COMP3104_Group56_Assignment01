Learning DevOps is essential in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) because it bridges the gap between development and operations teams. By automating processes, DevOps enables continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), allowing faster delivery of high-quality software. DevOps improves collaboration, reduces manual errors, and enhances the efficiency of the entire SDLC, from planning and coding to testing and deployment. As more organizations adopt agile and DevOps practices, the demand for professionals with these skills continues to grow.

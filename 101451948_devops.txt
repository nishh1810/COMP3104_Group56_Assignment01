The COMP 3104 DevOps course introduces students to the principles and practices of DevOps. DevOps is a set of software development practices aimed at shortening the development life cycle and ensuring continuous delivery with high software quality.

In this course, students will learn about:

- Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) to automate integration and deployment processes.
- Collaboration and communication techniques in DevOps teams.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for managing infrastructure using code.
- Monitoring and logging to track application performance.

By the end of the course, students will understand how to apply DevOps practices in software development projects, preparing them for careers in modern software engineering.

DevOps is essential in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because
it fosters collaboration between development and operations teams, leading 
to smoother workflows. It enables faster delivery through automation, 
reducing manual errors and accelerating deployment. DevOps also improves
software quality by integrating continuous testing and feedback, 
ensuring that issues are identified and resolved early. Overall, it enhances 
efficiency, reliability, and scalability in software development, making 
it crucial in modern SDLC practices.

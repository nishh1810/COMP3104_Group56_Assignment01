DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.It focuses on automation, collaboration, and integrating processes between teams to improve efficiency.By using DevOps, organizations can deploy updates faster, reduce errors, enhance system reliability, and respond to market demands more effectively.The goal is to create a seamless process where development, testing, and deployment are streamlined, enabling frequent and reliable software releases.DevOps goes beyond just merging development and operations; it transforms the way teams work by fostering a culture of shared responsibility, continuous improvement, and accountability.
